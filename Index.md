Darl.ai documentation
=====================
Darl.ai is a site that allows you to build and host bots.
It works with the Microsoft Bot Framework (tm) and makes it simple to build a bot that can be accessed via facebook, skype and many other chat interfaces.

It consists of a conversational layer and a rule based layer.

The conversational layer works out the user's intent, and the rule based layer pulls up the appropriate expert system to process data further.

Bots are either undirected, like Alexa or Siri, or directed like most bot framework bots. Undirected bots take in any input and try to make sense of it. Directed bots take over the conversation and direct it.

Darl has an undirected layer over a directed system.
